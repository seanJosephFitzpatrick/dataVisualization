# Final Year Project
###### Sean Fitzpatrick

## Introduction

This project is based on Data Visualization. Visually representing data using visual aids such as charts. The data will be held on a Neo4j Graph database. 
The database will be hosted on a cloud computing platform called Windows Azure  that allows end users to host applications on virtual machines, servers and databases. The languages used for the Data Visualization project will be HTML  Hyper Text Markup Language, JavaScript  and JQuery . The client side application will be rendered and loaded in the browser.


## Technology

Neo4j is a NoSQL Graph Database. Data is represented in the database as nodes and as directed-relationships between those nodes. Nodes and relationships can hold additional information known as properties. If a node represents a person then the properties of that node might be age, sex, height, Personal Identification Number. A relationship between two person nodes might represent a paternal relationship such as brother and sister. There would be a relationship from the male node saying “Brother of” female node and a relationship from the female node saying “Sister of” male node. These relationships may also contain properties that would be specific to the relationship between the two nodes; such as a school, gym or swimming club that may have been attended by both nodes.

Neo4j  is a highly scalable native graph database that leverages data relationships as first-class entities, helping enterprises build intelligent applications to meet today’s evolving data challenges.
A graph is composed of two elements: a node and a relationship.
Each node represents an entity (a person, place, thing, category or other piece of data), and each relationship represents how two nodes are associated. This general-purpose structure allows you to model all kinds of scenarios – from a system of roads, to a network of devices, to a population’s medical history or anything else defined by relationships.
A graph database  is an online database management system with Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD) operations working on a graph data model.
Unlike other databases, relationships take first priority in graph databases. This means your application doesn’t have to infer data connections using things like foreign keys or out-of-band processing, such as MapReduce.
 

D3.js  is a JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data. D3 helps you bring data to life using HTML, SVG, and CSS. D3’s emphasis on web standards gives you the full capabilities of modern browsers without tying yourself to a proprietary framework, combining powerful visualization components and a data-driven approach to DOM manipulation.

JavaScript is an interpreted language that has support built into all modern web browsers. Code can be written in a text editor and run directly in the browser. Some text editors like Notepad++ or Brackets have built in functions for executing the code in a browser.

Dropbox  is a Web-based file hosting service operated by Dropbox, Inc. that uses cloud computing to enable users to store and share files and folders with others across the Internet using file synchronization.

Windows Azure  is a cloud computing hosting site that allows you to create Virtual machine, servers and databases and run applications in the cloud. I am using this service for hosting the Neo4j database as the service is free as part of the module.  Neo4j has its own web server and is configured to listen on all ports. The code is on Dropbox and is synced to a web server on Windows Azure.
